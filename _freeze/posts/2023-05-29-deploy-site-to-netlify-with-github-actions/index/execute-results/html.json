I am keen on constructing and deploying this website with the seamless integration of [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [{{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). By utilizing [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), I can ensure that rendering and publishing processes are effortlessly triggered with every commit made to the remote repository on [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/). To facilitate this, I rely on the powerful IDE called [{{< iconify cib rstudio >}} RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), which enables me to efficiently code the pipeline, including the creation of the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website, setting up [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and establishing a connection with [{{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Once implemented, any commit, regardless of the IDE used, will automatically build and deploy the website to [{{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It would be delightful to utilize this as a template for all my future research projects.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   The [{{< iconify cib rstudio >}} RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) IDE (to code the pipeline)\n\n-   A [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/) account (to be able to use [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions))\n\n-   A [{{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify](https://netlify.com/) account (to publish the website to)\n\n## Step-by-step guide\n\nHere, the steps are given that you must follow to build a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website for [the use case](index.qmd#use-case). In the next section, you will see how to get the same results fully relying on [{{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify](https://netlify.com/) instead of [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). After that, it is shown how to use the [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/) template. Using this template, you do not need to manually perform this guide step-by-step each time you need a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website as a starter.\n\n1.  Fire up [{{< iconify cib rstudio >}} RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) and choose `File` → `New Project…` → `New Directory` → `Quarto Website`\n\n2.  Fill out the details in the panel, for example like in the figure below, and click on the `Create Project` button: ![](img/rstudio-create-new-project.png)\n\n3.  Execute the `quarto publish` [command for {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#publish-command) in the **Terminal** pane of [{{< iconify cib rstudio >}} RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/):\n\n    ```{.bash}\n    quarto publish netlify\n    ```\n\n    After you press `Y` to publish with you default account, this automatically creates a `_publish.yml` file in the local repository that looks like the example below, but with the appropriate id and url values for your site:\n\n    ```{.yaml}\n    - source: project\n      netlify:\n        - id: d1983ae8-da83-4431-928f-3debf80a02a5\n          url: 'https://splendorous-bublanina-d544bb.netlify.app'\n    ```\n\n4.  Add the following lines to the `_quarto.yml` file in order to make sure that [code is only executed locally](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#freezing-computations-1):\n\n    ```{.yaml}\n    execute:\n      freeze: auto  # Re-render only when source changes\n    ```\n\n5.  Fully re-render your site in the **Terminal** pane:\n\n    ```{.bash}\n    quarto render\n    ```\n\n6.  Add the output directory of your project to .gitignore:\n\n    ```{.bash}   \n    /_site/\n    ```\n\n7.  Go to the Git pane of [{{< iconify cib rstudio >}} RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) to commit the files created thus far to your local repository: `Git` → `Commit pending changes` → select all files → `Stage` all files → write a `Commit message`, for example 'First commit' → click the `Commit` button.\n\n8.  Execute this command in the **Console** pane of [{{< iconify cib rstudio >}} RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) to push your local repo to [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/):\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    usethis::use_github(private = TRUE)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n    ```\n    Error: User input required, but session is not interactive.\n    Query: There are uncommitted changes and we're about to create and push to a new GitHub repo\n    Do you want to proceed anyway?\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n    This will create a **private** remote repository at [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/). You may change the argument `private` to `FALSE` if you want the remote repository to be **public** right away, or change this manually in the settings section of your [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/) repository at some later moment.\n\n9.  Add [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to your project by creating the YAML file `publish.yml` and save it to `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:\n\n    ```{.yaml}\n    on:\n      workflow_dispatch:\n      push:\n        branches: main\n\n    name: Quarto Publish\n\n    jobs:\n      build-deploy:\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n        steps:\n          - name: Check out repository\n            uses: actions/checkout@v2 \n\n          - name: Set up Quarto\n            uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n          - name: Render and Publish\n            uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n            with:\n              target: netlify\n              NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n    ```\n\n10. Configure your [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/) with the credentials required for publishing to {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This is explained [in the Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#netlify-credentials). In short:\n\n    -   find/create a personal access token at [the {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify applications page](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications)\n    -   go to the remote repository at {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub → `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → click on the button `New repository secret`\n    -   fill out the name (i.e. `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`) and value of the personal access token\n\n11. Commit the `publish.yml` file and subsequently push your local repository (including the `_freeze` directory) to [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/). As a consequence, your [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow will start running and the website is automatically rendered and published to {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Each subsequent (commit and) push will trigger the [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow to start running in the same way.\n\nThe [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website that is described in this example was automatically named [https://splendorous-bublanina-d544bb.netlify.app/]{.underline}] by {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify. To remember it better, I renamed it to [https://template-quarto-website.netlify.app/](https://template-quarto-website.netlify.app/) in my {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify account. I changed the `url` field in the `_publish.yml` file accordingly. You can visit the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website at this latter URL.\n\nThe remote repository is located at [https://github.com/pjastam/template-quarto-website/](https://github.com/pjastam/template-quarto-website/). Note that this repository is set up as a template, see the section [\"A versatile template\"](index.qmd#a-versatile-template).\n\n## ~~GitHub Actions~~\n\nThroughout this guide, I have assumed the utilization of a [GitHub Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) to execute the job defined by the [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow. Note that achieving the same outcome is possible without relying on [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). More specifically, you can delegate the responsibility of rendering the website to {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) itself, which seamlessly handles the entire process before deploying it to their servers. To follow this alternative approach, simply skip the last three steps (9-11) outlined in this how-to guide and [add two extra files](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#plugin-configuration) after adding the .gitigore file (i.e., after step 6). The files that must be added are a `netlify.toml` file with the following lines of code:\n\n```{.toml}   \n[[plugins]]\npackage = \"@quarto/netlify-plugin-quarto\"\n```\n\nand a `package.json` file with the following lines of code:\n\n```{.json} \n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@quarto/netlify-plugin-quarto\": \"^0.0.5\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinalize with committing all files to you local repository (step 7) and pushing your local repository to {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub (step 8). Again, do **not** execute steps 9-11 in this scenario.\n\n## A versatile template\n\nThe remote repository that results from the steps described in this step-by-step guide is located at [https://github.com/pjastam/template-quarto-website](https://github.com/pjastam/template-quarto-website). To use it as a template repository for your [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) websites, I have checked the `Template repository` box in the `Settings` tab of this remote repository. Furthermore, note that the two lines of code with the Netlify credentials (see step 3 of the [step-by-step guide](index.qmd#step-by-step-guide)) are commented out (i.e. deactivated). In this way, people are guarded from mistakenly using these credentials instead of the Netflify credentials of their own site.\n\nTo actually use this template, there are 6 steps involved:\n\n1.  Use my template to create your new repository by clicking this button at the top of the remote repository:\n\n    ![](img/github-use-this-template.png)\n\n2.  Fire up [{{< iconify cib rstudio >}} RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), choose `File` → `New Project…` → `Version Control` → `Git` and fill out the web URL [https://github.com/pjastam/template-quarto-website.git](https://github.com/pjastam/template-quarto-website.git) to clone your new repository to your local environment.\n\n3.  Delete the `_publish.yml` file from your local repository.\n\n4.  Execute step 3 of the [step-by-step guide](index.qmd#step-by-step-guide).\n\n    ::: {.callout-caution}\n    Before continuing with step 5, please double-check that the `_publish.yml` file in your local repository now contains **your own {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify credentials**. Otherwise the workflow will never run the right way.\n    :::\n\n5.  Execute step 10 of the [step-by-step guide](index.qmd#step-by-step-guide).\n\n6.  Execute step 11 of the [step-by-step guide](index.qmd#step-by-step-guide).\n\nYour [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website will be up and running any moment.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nIn this guide, I have created a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website to be used as a research compendium.[^1] However, the current content is rather limited for this use case. I plan to enhance it with essential compendium components and publish that repository on [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/) in the near future. You can use that as a reference template for your own research compendium, so stay tuned for updates!\n\n[^1]: [The Quarto docs about publishing on {{< iconify bxl netlify >}} Netlify](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html) were a nice starting point for this how-to guide.\n",
