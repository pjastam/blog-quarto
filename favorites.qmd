## Favorite tools

I am very much indebted to the open source community, among them the contributors to [Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/) to name a few. The software provided by these communities opened up a world of open source tools to me that was very useful for creating my own lines of code, the results of which can be found at [my GitHub site](https://github.com/pjastam/). Below I give my respect to the authors of these open source tools by listing the references to their creative work. You may wanna start using some of these tools too...
