We estimated the odds of football matches in the last two weeks of the 2018/2019 Dutch Eredivisie football competiton. All results and my explanations can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pjastam/r-bayesian-football-odds/blob/1409c9e8bbcfe92d8526e2fc866e0f7a57549d60/NL_eredivisie_2014_2019.nb.html).

If you are interested in the code of the hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model, you can find that on [GitHub](https://github.com/pjastam/r-bayesian-football-odds).
