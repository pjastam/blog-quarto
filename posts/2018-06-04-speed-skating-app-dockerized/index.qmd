A Docker image of the [Shiny app](https://pjastam.shinyapps.io/speedskating/) for talent scouting & development of junior speed skaters was created. It is available for download at Docker Hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/pjastam/shiny-speedskating/). You can also find more about the how to there. An interactive demo of the (non-Dockerized) Shiny app can be found [here](https://pjastam.shinyapps.io/speedskating/).
