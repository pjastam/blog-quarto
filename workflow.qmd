## Zotero
  
I manage my references using [Zotero](https://zotero.org/). While reading a manuscript, I add color-coded annotations. After completing the reading, I create a note from these annotations and then reorganize and refine the content.

Add-ons: [Zotero Tag](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-actions-tags), [Better BibTeX](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex)

## Obsidian

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my knowledge management. I fetch the metadata from the manuscripts that have been stored in Zotero, including the Note from Annotations.

Plugins: Templater, Zotero Integration

## Microsoft 365

I use the Microsoft 365 tools on a daily basis. More specifically, I use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, Sharepoint, and Planner.

Add-ons: [Think-Cell](https://www.think-cell.com/en/)

## Quarto

I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for creating websites. For example, this homepage of mine is created with Quarto.

Add-ons: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

## R and RStudio

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for finding relationships among variables in data sets. [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) is used as my preferred IDE for R programming.

I activated [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for code completion in RStudio. To this end, I applied the 9 steps as decribed in [the Setup section](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html#setup) of the RStudio User Guide. In addition, you may toggle on the setting "Copilot Indexing" to index and read from other R, Python, or SQL files available in the current project than the active document alone (Tools --> Global Options --> Copilot --> “Index project files with GitHub Copilot)”.

I use the chattr package to to interact with GPT 4 and 3.5 in the Viewer pane of RStudio. You can initialize the chattr package running the R code in [my gist file](https://gist.github.com/pjastam/ec0e664fb2d620107873aba6e0f3d621). Note that, before you run this file, you should include your personal OpenAI secret key first. Of course, you also have the option to manually configure the chattr package by following the steps in [the chattr user guide](https://mlverse.github.io/chattr/).

Plugins: [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [chattr](https://mlverse.github.io/chattr/)
